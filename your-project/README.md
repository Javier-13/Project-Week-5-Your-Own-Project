## Project Description
So I'm sure that all of us have at least someone that has told us happiness has nothing to do with money, that you can be rich and so depressed as well as poor and really happy, but is this true?

That is what I will try to figure out by comparing the richness of the people with their happiness to see if it is just an urban legend or if actually we can trsut the people who told us so.

## Hypotheses / Questions
Is it better to be happy or wealthy? 
Hypothesis: Probably there is no difference between poor and rich people when talking about happiness as it has nothing to do with wealthiness but a personal perception

## Dataset
All my data is based on trustful organizations such as the world bank, the world happiness report and the heritage foundation

## Workflow
The first step is to think about a question and when you have it start wondering how possible is it to be an acceptable question (to get enough and quality data)

After we are sure about what our project is about then we should start looking for all the datasets we need in order to get the necessary tables from them

Cleaning all the data is one of the most important parts of the project, prepare it and when you have it done take a look and start working with statistics

After we got all of this work done, then make visualizations and prepare the presentation and all the literature
